# Detecting Pneumonia in Pediatric Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning

#### [Greg Tozzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorytozzi/) | May, 2020

*This is a portion of my final group project from the [applied machine learning](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/207) course that I took as part of the UC Berkeley School of Information's [Master of Information and Data Science](https://datascience.berkeley.edu) program.  Deep learning was not an integral part of the course, but we were encouraged to incorporate it into our final project through self-study.*


**Skills demonstrated:** *Deep Learning for Computer Vision* | *Getting and transforming image data* | *Evaluating model performance*

**Languages and frameworks**: *Python* | *NumPy* | *TensorFlow*
